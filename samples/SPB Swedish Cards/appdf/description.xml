                <full-description>
                    Traditional flash cards for learning Swedish language enhanced with smartphone technologies like photos, native speakers' dubbing, learning progress visualization, smart adaptive algorithm, and detailed statistics. The program helps you to skip the stage of translating a word into your mother tongue first, but memorizing a direct match of a subject and a foreign word instead.
